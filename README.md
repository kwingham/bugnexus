this project was created by Kyle, SHaun, Amgda and Jonathan.

The aim was to create an app for users new to coding to get assistance from the community when starting out.

The style is based on a stack overflow/reddit design with comments to posts and sub comments to comments.

we achieved our main gaol, but did not fully manage to integrate prismjs syntax highlighter to single posts or comments due to time constraints and bug issues.

additionals used were prismjs for syntax highlighting and shadcn for a burger menu, with clerk for authorisation.

the app itself has several areas where conditional rendering has been used to make for better user interaction.

the add posts button will redirect you to the create profile page if no profile is detected or you can add a post if there is a profile.

in the profile there are several areas, a message will display if no profile is detected, a sign in button will display if not signed in, a message will display no posts yet if the user has not made any posts or a list of posts by the user will be displayed.

on the single posts page if it is a post created by the logged in user you are able to delete and edit the post, but if it not the users post these options will not appear.

there were a few more things we would of liked to have achieved such as added upvotes to comments to show the best answers (like stackoverflow) options to edit/delete comments and to finish implementing prismjs.

other stretch goals we thought about were gamifying the site, like badges for the number of replys to make it more rewarding for the community to help the student.
emails sent to the poster when they recieved an answer.

overall this was a nice concept for us to work on, but the number of bugs we ran into hindered the amount we could achieve in the time frame, but the majority we managed to work together to fix the bugs, but on 3 occasions Frankie came in at the right time to help us.

i would like to credit Shaun Church for the diddit app as some of out code was taken from that app to help with nested comments.

youtube videos for help with search and news functions.

prismjs docs were a little out of date as we had to --legacy-peer-deps to ignore the dependencies, but overall we managed to add it in.

and lastly i would like to thank Tech Educators, especially Sam and Frankie for the amazing 12 weeks we have had together and i am shocked at how far i personally have come, coming from knowing nothing at all, to be practically Job Ready and its all down to how the excellent structure and patience, i will forever grateful for this experience.
