# Welcome to Our Community Coding App!

Created by Kyle, Shaun, Magdalena, and Jonathan, this app is designed to support users new to coding by connecting them with a helpful community. Inspired by Stack Overflow and Reddit, it allows users to post questions, comment, and build a supportive network for learning.

## **Key Features:**

Community Q&A: Post questions, receive comments, and engage with threaded conversations.

Conditional User Experience: Tailored interactions based on user status:

- Not signed in? Youâ€™ll see prompts to sign in.
- No profile yet? Weâ€™ll guide you in creating one before posting.
- Logged-in users can view their posts and edit or delete their content.

Tech Stack: We used Prism.js for syntax highlighting (although it was not fully implemented due to time constraints), shadcn for an Accessibility-First Design, and a responsive menu, and lastly Clerk for authentication.

### Future Enhancements:

- `Upvotes & Gamification: Adding features like upvoting and badges to make helping others more rewarding.`
- `Email Notifications: Alert users when their question receives a response.`

**Challenges & Acknowledgements:** We encountered some technical challenges, especially bugs and dependency issues, but it was a rewarding learning experience. Special thanks to Frankie for swooping in with solutions when needed and to Tech Educators Sam and Frankie for their guidance throughout these 12 weeks. The growth we've experienced has been incredible!

**Enjoy exploring our app!** ðŸ˜Š
